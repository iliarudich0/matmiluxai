# TikMahik AI — landing site (generated)

This package is a minimal, privacy-first landing site prepared for app store verification (Google Play / App Store). It contains templates and guidance; **you must replace placeholders** (YOUR_EMAIL@example.com, third-party services) before publishing.

## Included files
- index.html — main landing page (dark UI).
- privacy.html — privacy policy template (update with exact services).
- terms.html — terms of service template.
- cookies.html — cookie policy.
- style.css — dark theme styling.
- manifest.json — PWA manifest (icons are placeholders).
- LICENSE.txt — MIT-like license.
- README.md — this file.

## Short checklist before publishing (Google/Apple)
1. Host these pages at a public HTTPS URL (your GitHub Pages or custom domain).
2. In Play Console / App Store, paste the privacy policy URL (HTTPS).
3. Fill contact email and exact third-party services.
4. If you send images to external OCR services, disclose that and link to their privacy policy.
5. Prepare App Store Data Safety form (list data types and purposes).

## Notes from our chats (short, non-sensitive)
- OCR & Math parsing workflow (local-first; optional Mathpix or third-party).
- Need for privacy explicitness if images are sent off-device.
- App navigation and OCR fixes (we discussed Flutter screens and navigation).
- Math step-by-step generation, possible integration with Mathpix or custom OCR.
- Minimizing exposed proprietary algorithm descriptions (keep product secret).
